    "* Reducing the input dimensionality is something you want because it forces the network to project its learned representations in a different and with lower dimensionality space. This is good computationally speaking because you have to allocate less memory and thus you can have bigger batches. But it's also something desirable because usually high-dimensional spaces have a lot of redundancy and are spaces in which all abjects appears to be sparse and dissimilar\n",

If some important feature has been found, max-pool preserves it regardless of its position\n",

If the input image is shifted by a small amount, then the max-pooling op produces the same output although the input is shifted (the maximum shift is thus equal to the kernel size).\n",
