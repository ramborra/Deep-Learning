# Deep-Learning

## Assignment 1: notMNIST
Preprocess notMNIST data and train a simple logistic regression model on it
### Achieved a Test Accuracy of 85.85%

## Assignment 2
Previously in 1_notmnist.ipynb, we created a pickle with formatted datasets for training, development and testing on the notMNIST dataset.

The goal of this assignment is to progressively train deeper and more accurate models using TensorFlow.
### Achieved a Test Accuracy of 94.1% using single hidden layer and 94.2% using two hidden layers

## Assignment 3
Previously in 2_fullyconnected.ipynb, you trained a logistic regression and a neural network model.
The goal of this assignment is to explore regularization techniques.

 ### Achieved a Test Accuracy of 90.2% using two hidden layers using Loss Regularization, Dropout and Exponential Decay.
 
## Assignment 4
The goal of this assignment is make the neural network convolutional. 
 
 ### Achieved a Test Accuracy of 90.3% using Dropout in CNN and 94.9% using Dropout, Regularization and Learning Rate Decay.
